# Pizza-Sales-Power-BI-and-SQL-Project
This is a Power BI and SQL project to analyze the pizza sales data from multiple tables and to build an interactive data visualizing dashboard to draw insights.


QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED:

1. Total Revenue (How much money did we make this year?)
2. Average Order Value
3. Total Pizzas Sold
4. Total Orders
5. Average Pizzas per Order
6. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category
7. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size
8. Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category
9. Top 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold
10. Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold

    FINDINGS:

1. Total Revenue for the year was $1.64M
2. Average Order Value was $49.5

3. Total Pizzas Sold – 50,000
4. Total Orders – 21,000
5. Average Pizzas per Order – 2

6. Classic pizza has the highest percentage of sales (26.91%), followed by Supreme (25.46%), Chicken (23.96%), and Veggie (23.68%) pizzas.

7. Large-size pizzas record the highest sales (45.89%) followed by medium (30.49%), then small (21.77%). XL and XXL only account for 1.72% and 0.12% respectively.

8. Classic Pizza accounts for the highest sales (14,888 pizzas) followed by Supreme (11,987 pizzas), Veggie (11,649 pizzas), and Chicken (11,050 pizzas).

9. Top 5 Best Sellers are the Classic Deluxe (2453 pizzas), Barbecue Chicken (2432 pizzas), Hawaiian (2422), Pepperoni (2418 pizzas), and Thai Chicken (2371 pizzas).

10. Bottom 5 Worst Sellers are Brie Carre (490 pizzas), Mediterranean (934 pizzas), Calabrese (937 pizzas), Spinach Supreme (950 pizzas) and Soppressata (961).77.


 CONCLUSION:

The outlet should capitalize on Large-size Classic, Supreme, Veggie, and Chicken pizzas.

Since XL and XXL pizzas account for such a small percentage of their sales (just 1.94%), they can safely get rid of these pizza sizes.

Even though the Brie Carre pizza is the worst seller, it recorded 490 pizzas sold. It would still be a good idea to keep it on the menu.
